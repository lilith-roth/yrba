# Installation

There are two main ways to install YRBA.

1. [Native Installation](./native-setup.md)
2. [Docker Container](./docker-setup.md)

The native installation will be directly installed in your system via Cargo, Nix, or your Linux packages.

Meanwhile, the docker container allows a simple solution without a lot of setup, and is perfect for servers that are
already utilizing Docker.
